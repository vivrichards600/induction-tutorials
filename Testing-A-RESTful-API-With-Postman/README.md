# Testing a RESTful API with Postman

*This tutorial follows on from the Building a RESTful API With Scala and Play tutorial from [here](https://github.com/miranda-hawkes/induction-tutorials/blob/master/Building-A-RESTful-API-With-Scala-Play/README.md).*

## This Tutorial
This tutorial walks you through the creation of a Postman collection for testing of an API that can store, retrieve, update and remove data. It covers these main concepts and technologies, some more in depth than others:
* Postman
* Testing a RESTful API with Postman

## Previous Knowledge
Its recommended you have some experience with the following, although it isn't completely required:
* RESTful APIs (tutorial [here](hhttps://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/whatisrest.html))
* HTTP request methods and response statuses (brief guide [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177))

Some of the sections are purposefully vague and get more challenging as you progress. This is intended - your colleagues, Slack, Confluence, GitHub are all valuable resources!

## Why Postman?
Postman is an interactive tool for verifying the APIs of your project. Postman is a tool for exploring and testing APIs. It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests and reading responses. It works on the backend, and makes sure that each API is working as intended.

Postman enables you to:
* Quickly and easily send REST, SOAP, and GraphQL requests directly.
* Automate manual tests and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any code changes won't break the API in production.
* Communicate the expected behavior of an API by simulating endpoints and their responses without having to set up a backend server.
* Generate and publish beautiful, machine-readable documentation to make your API easier to consume.
* Stay up-to-date on the health of your API by checking performance and response times at scheduled intervals.
* Provide a shared context for building and consuming APIs, and collaborate in real-time with built-in version control.

There are lots of tools available to test APIs but for this tutorial, we'll be using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
